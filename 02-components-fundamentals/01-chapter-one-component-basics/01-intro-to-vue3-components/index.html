<!-- 
  In this example, we have a simple Vue 3 component called ClickCounter.
  We are using this component three times in the template to display three separate instances of the component.
  Each instance of the component maintains its own state and behavior independently of the others.
  This allows us to reuse the same component multiple times without any interference between instances.

  IMPORTANT: There is also a bug in the rendering of the component. When use self-close tag, the component is not rendered multiple times.
